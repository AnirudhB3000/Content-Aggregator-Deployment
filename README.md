While conducting research, it is often cumbersome to look through an entire article to find all relevant information which can be summarised in just a few lines. Even whilst creating social media posts, one needs to summarise many words in the best way possible.

Thus, our project aims to decrease the word count of articles and thus make it easier to understand for those in a hurry

This system will be most useful to content creators and social media managers. With the help of this web application, they can save hours and quite possibly even days of work.
